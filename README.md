# duplicate-eliminator
Get rid of your duplicate files.

This is a simple utility for removing duplicated files anywhere on your system. It's written in python, so it will run on any OS. It uses hashing to determine if files are duplicated or not.
At the moment, it's a very simple interface: as it runs through, you are given the option to delete or leave duplicate files one by one.

### roadmap
1. Clean up. Make it OS-independent (I think it's set up for Mac right now).
2. GUI? It currently works OK for programmers, but not anyone else...
